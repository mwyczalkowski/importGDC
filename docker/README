Create simple docker container to use at MGI
based on ~/src/BreakpointSurveyor/docker/Dockerfile.mgi

See corresponding workflow on MGI at /gscuser/mwyczalk/projects/CPTAC3

This is now associated with an automatic build on Dockerhub:
    docker pull mwyczalkowski/importgdc

The idea is that when changes occur to the github repository, this will trigger a rebuild on dockerhub to reflect these changes.
Currently this does not seem to be working...
Rebuilds can be forced by adding trival changes (e.g. whitespace) to the Dockerfile 'git clone' command

Also note: it may be necessary to login to dockerhub with,

    docker login
